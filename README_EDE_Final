## Summary
This dataset was prepared in Fall 2023 as a final project for Environmental Data Analytics (ENV 872) at Duke University's Nicholas School of the Environment.

The repository contains 10 years of data (2010-2020) detailing the United State's renewable energy generation capacity by governing state political party.

The purpose is to analyze the relationship between renewable energy growth at the state-level and political party leadership (using governor as a proxy). The research questions to be answered are: (1) What is the relationship between the percent penetration of renewable technology (i.e., solar, wind) and state governor?
(2) Has renewable penetration grown in any states that have had a single-party governor over a longer period of time?

We employed three types of analysis in order to answer these questions: (1) linear regression, (2) time series analysis, and (3) spatial analysis.

## Database Information
Data were accessed from two different sites.

(1) US Governors Data:
https://www.openicpsr.org/openicpsr/project/102000/version/V3/view?path=/openicpsr/102000/fcr:versions/V3/united_states_governors_1775_2020.csv&type=file

Data were collected from Open ICPSR - an open source database. The file contains records for state governor by political party affiliation and years in office spanning 1775 - 2020. More info can be found here: https://www.openicpsr.org/openicpsr/project/102000/version/V3/view

Data were downloaded directly from ICPSR's website using the first link provided above. From the link:

File was downloaded and saved as a CSV file.

Data were accessed 2023-11-15.

(2) eGRID 2010-2020:
https://www.epa.gov/egrid/download-data

Data were collected from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Emissions & Generation Resource Integrated Database (eGRID), which contains data on generation capacity and emissions factors associated with almost all power generating assets in the U.S.. More information can be found here: https://www.epa.gov/egrid

Note: eGRID data is released every two years. To amass ten years of data we aggregated the datasets for 2020, 2018, 2016, 2014, 2012, and 2010.

Data were collected directly from the EPA eGrid site (https://www.epa.gov/egrid). The following steps were taken from this homepage:
* Download Detailed Data (scroll down, button in center of page)
* Historical eGRID Data (scroll down, button at bottom of page)
* Download eGRID2020, eGRID2018 as Excel files
* Download eGRID Historical Files 1996-2016 as zip file
* Open zipped file and select eGRID2016, eGRID2014, eGRID2012, eGRID2010

Five files were saved as `eGRID2020.xlsx`, `eGRID2018.xlsx`, `eGRID2016.xlsx`, `eGRID2014.xlsx`,`eGRID2012.xlsx`,`eGRID2010.xlsx` 

Data were accessed 2023-11-15.

## Metadata
<For each data file in the repository, describe the data contained in each column. Include the column name, a description of the information, the class of data, and any units associated with the data. Create a list or table for each data file.> 


Columns in Raw eGRID files (PLNT tabs)
* Only the PLNT tab was utilized for each dataset. The PLNT tab contains plant-level data for U.S. generation assets.
* Please see pages 42 - 57 of eGRID's technical guide for descriptions of column names for the plant tab used in analysis: https://www.epa.gov/system/files/documents/2023-01/eGRID2021_technical_guide.pdf
* Note-worthy columns include:
--> PNAME: Name of generation asset
--> PSTATABB: U.S. state abbreviation
--> NAMEPCAP: Nameplate capacity of generating asset in Megawatts (MW)
--> PLFUELCT: The fuel category for the primary fuel of the plant (e.g. wind, solar, nuclear, biomass, hydro)
--> ORISPL: Office of Regulatory Information Systems Plant code
--> LAT: Plant latitude
--> LON: Plant longitude


Columns in Raw US_Governors file:
* governor: Name of state governor
* state: Full U.S. state name
* time_in_office: Time governor held office (term)
* party: Democrat, Republican, Independent, New Progressive Party (Puerto Rico), etc.
